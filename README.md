HydraConsole
==============

Hydra is a lightweight vocabulary to create hypermedia-driven Web APIs. By
specifying a number of concepts commonly used in Web APIs it renders the
creation of generic API clients possible.

HydraConsole is an implementation of such a generic API client in the form
of a single-page application.

***This is highly experimental stuff that isn't ready for production use.***

To participate in the development of please file bugs and issues in the
issue tracker or submit pull requests. If there's enough interest I'll
create a dedicated mailing list in the future.

You can find more information about Hydra and a demo on my homepage:
